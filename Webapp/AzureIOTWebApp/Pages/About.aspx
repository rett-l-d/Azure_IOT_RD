                 <p>
                     I'm an Electrical and Software Engineer with over a decade
                     of experience developing innovative solutions for the manufacturing
                     industry. My work spans across a broad spectrum — from
                     small-scale embedded systems and control software to hardware
                     integration, enterprise applications, and modern cloud-based web platforms.
                     Throughout my career, I’ve been focused on empowering customers
                     with world-class solutions that enhance operational efficiency
                     and drive profitability. Whether it’s optimizing industrial processes or
                     building scalable software systems, I strive to deliver reliable, high-performance technology.
                     I'm deeply passionate about cutting-edge technologies, particularly
                     in the realm of software development. Writing code is not just my
                     profession — it's a craft I enjoy both as a creative outlet and a
                     tool for solving real-world challenges.
